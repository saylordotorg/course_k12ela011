**Unit 7: Exploring Freedom: The Modern Era** <span id="7"></span> 
**Now that all men and women were recognized as free and equal, there
was nothing holding one back from achieving the American Dream, right?
Wrong. Our nation was about to experience two setbacks of epic
proportions: World War I and the Great Depression. With our nation’s
morale and pocketbooks at an all-time low, people began to question
whether the American Dream was nothing more than a fairy tale. People
were beginning to realize that the promises of equality and opportunity
were not always realized. This sentiment was expressed in modern
literature in a variety of ways, both subtly and blatantly. In this
unit, we will explore the ideas of notable modernist authors as well as
the literary techniques they employed to express them. **

**7.1 Overview of the Modern Era** <span id="7.1"></span> 
**Having emerged from what some considered a barbaric time of slavery,
suppression, and war, Americans now wanted to break free from the past.
In order to do so, they embraced industry and technology in an effort to
create a brighter future. Still, many of the values of the past
generations became lost in this attempt to move away from times gone by.
Thus, the modern era represents a time of experimentation. Like most
experiments, there were successes and there were failures. **

     Instructions: Authors have different styles of writing. A writer’s
    unique style can be determined by various factors, including
    descriptiveness, sentence and clause length, types of sentences
    used, vocabulary, word choice, dialogue, dialect, and voice. Use
    this worksheet to compare and contrast Hemingway’s style to Mark
    Twain’s style. Pay particular attention to the types of adjectives
    and adverbs used, clause length, sentence length, paragraph length,
    use of dialogue, use of vernacular, and choice of punctuation.  
        
     Then, write a comparison and contrast essay explaining the
    similarities and differences in the two styles portrayed in the
    paragraphs provided. Your essay should have an introduction, thesis
    statement, body with transition statements, and conclusion. Be sure
    to cite specific examples from each paragraph to support your
    claims. Share your essay via your personal blog or in The Saylor
    Foundation’s [discussion
    forum](http://forums.saylor.org/topic/7-2-6-ernest-hemingways-three-shots/)
    and ask for feedback. Make changes to the essay as necessary based
    on this ongoing feedback.

    Choice”](http://edsitement.neh.gov/lesson-plan/three-shots-ernest-hemingways-nick-adams#section-16065)  
      
     Instructions: Another aspect of style is the author’s narrative
    choice. When the author chooses who will tell the story, whether it
    is a character in the story (first person) or someone outside of the
    story (third person), it has a significant impact on the style and
    consequently, the mood of the story. Another aspect of narrative
    choice involves how much the narrator knows about the thoughts and
    feelings of other characters in the story.  
        
     While a third person limited narrator has limited information about
    the other characters, a third person omniscient narrator knows
    everything about every character. With this in mind, click on the

*If any or all of the units you have studied in the course have ignited
an interest in learning more, the following list will help you. It
contains books and other resources you can use for further study. You
will most likely be able to find many of these items in your local
public library.*

-   **Reading: *The Sound and the Fury* by William Faulkner**
    *The Sound and the Fury* is written in stream-of-conscious style
    from a multi-narrative perspective. It tells the story of the
    members of the Compton family, who are struggling with financial
    hardships while attempting to maintain their reputation, morality,
    and faith in God. 

-   **Reading: *The Great Gatsby* by F. Scott Fitzgerald**
    *The Great Gatsby *is set in the fictional city of West Egg on Long
    Island. A tragic tale of greed, adultery, and deception set during
    the Jazz Age, many critics believe it is a warning to readers about
    the pitfalls to avoid while pursuing the American dream. 

-   **Reading: *The Old Man and the Sea* by Ernest Hemmingway**
    Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, *The Old Man and the Sea*
    is the tale of an elderly Cuban fisherman named Santiago who battles
    with a huge marlin in the Gulf Stream. Aside from being quite an
    adventure story, the novel is an intense character study full of
    symbolism and irony.

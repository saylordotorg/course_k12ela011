**Unit 4: Embracing Freedom: The Transcendentalists** <span
id="4"></span> 
**If Cooper, Irving, and Bryant set out to establish a national literary
identity, Emerson and Thoreau were determined to revolutionize it. These
two literary giants were enlightened, educated men with the intellectual
prowess to tackle life’s big questions head on: Who are we? Why are we
here? Who (or what) is God? Challenging their Puritan roots, these
authors and others who followed in their footsteps sought to redefine
spirituality in America, and some would say they were successful. In
this unit, you will have a front - row seat as we watch the literary
landscape in America change before our very eyes. **

**4.1 Transcendental Movement and Literature** <span id="4.1"></span> 
**In this unit, you will examine how Emerson, Thoreau, and Whitman
revolutionized the national literary identity. Their works depart from
the staunch Puritan mindset and establish transcendentalism as the
nation’s first American philosophical and literary movement. Whole -
hearted optimism, the inherent good of the individual, the corrupting
influence of organized religion, and the celebration of nature are some
of the transcendentalist themes that you will explore in this unit.**

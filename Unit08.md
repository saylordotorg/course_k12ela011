**8.1 Historical Overview** <span id="8.1"></span> 
*Although slavery was abolished in 1865, it took decades before former
slaves felt truly free to express themselves. A major milestone in the
development of African American art and culture was the Harlem
Renaissance. The term “Renaissance” is French for “rebirth.” As you’ll
learn in this subunit, the key players in this movement sought to
redefine the African American community as one that offered society
beautiful art, music, and poetry. *

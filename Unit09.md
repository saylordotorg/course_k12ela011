**9.1 Literature of the 20th Century** <span id="9.1"></span> 
*As the United States emerged from the Great Depression, many
individuals began to realize the American Dream by gaining wealth and
prosperity. However, many authors of the day sought to bring light to
the problems inherent with this newfound success, such as a lack of
personal contentment and even issues with immorality. In this subunit,
we will examine the works of one of the most notable authors of this
period, Flannery O’Connor. *

    story, “A Good Man Is Hard to Find.” Note how the author of the

    Misfit’s inability to grasp the future (i.e., eternity) as the
    excuse for his amorality. Recall the events and dialogue of the
    story itself. How does the author play with the ideas of nostalgia
    and eternity as forms of distraction from the present moment? Write

     Instructions: After listening to and watching video representations
    of a selection of Sylvia Plath’s poems, you should have a good grasp
    of the poet’s style and themes. Please write an essay in which you
    discuss how the author uses certain poetic devices such as imagery,
    simile, metaphor, and repetition, among others, to convey a certain
    theme or themes in her poems.  
        
     You may need to replay the poems multiple times and consult a
    dictionary to look up unfamiliar words. Be sure that your essay has
    an introduction, body, and conclusion, and that you use the third
    person point of view and an objective tone when writing. Use the
    revision and editing techniques we discussed in previous units to
    create a final draft. You may use the poems we’ve covered in this
    unit as the basis for your essay or seek out other poems by Sylvia
    Plath.

**9.5 Extension Resources** <span id="9.5"></span> 
*If any or all of the units you have studied in the course have ignited
an interest in learning more, the following list will help you. It
contains books and other resources you can use for further study. You
will most likely be able to find many of these items in your local
public library.*

-   **Reading: *The Death of a Salesman* by Arthur Miller**
    Winner of the 1949 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and Tony Award for Best
    Drama, *The Death of a Salesman *is a tragedy centered on main
    character Willy Loman, a frustrated salesman who obsesses over his
    own lack of success as well as the seeming failure of his sons. The
    play grapples with the definition of success and criticizes American
    materialism. 

-   **Reading: *Fahrenheit 451* by Ray Bradbury**
    *Fahrenheit 451 *is an example of dystopian literature written by
    famous American mystery writer Ray Bradbury. The book is set in the
    future in a society where books are outlawed and burned upon
    confiscation. The title of the book is derived from the temperature
    at which paper burns. 

-   **Reading: *Catch - 22* by Joseph Heller**
    Often referred to as one of the greatest literary works of the 20th
    century, *Catch - 22 *is a satire on bureaucracy and the circular
    reasoning that often governs it. The now ubiquitous term “catch -
    22” is derived from the title of the book and is used to describe a
    no-win situation. The novel is set during World War II and
    chronicles the experiences of a fictional Air Force bombardier,
    Captain John Yossarian. 

-   **Reading: *To Kill a Mockingbird* by Harper Lee**
    A well-known American classic, *To Kill a Mockingbird *is narrated
    by young Scout Finch, whose father defends an African American man
    accused of raping a white woman. The novel explores many important
    themes such as racism, justice, and heroism. Although not an
    autobiography, the events of the novel are loosely based on the
    author’s own experiences growing up in Monroeville, Alabama. 

-   **Reading: *Beloved* by Toni Morrison**
    *Beloved* tells the story of main character Sethe, who attempts to
    escape slavery with her four children. The novel is based on the
    true life events of an African American slave named Margaret Garner.
    In 1988, *Beloved* received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and a
    decade later was adapted into a film starring Oprah Winfrey.

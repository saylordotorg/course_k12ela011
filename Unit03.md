**Unit 3: Seeking a National Literary Identity** <span id="3"></span> 
**In the last unit, we analyzed American foundational documents and
discovered how the pen, being indeed mightier than the sword,
contributed to our independence from Great Britain. With this newfound
freedom came a desire to seek a national identity and make a name for
ourselves in the worlds of art and culture, including literature. As
writers sought to distinguish themselves from their British
counterparts, some of the first great American literary works were
born. **

**3.1 Seeking a Literary Identity: Fiction** <span id="3.1"></span> 
**After the Revolutionary War, the United States gradually developed a
separate cultural identity from Great Britain. In this subunit, we will
read texts from what are considered the first generation of great
American writers. James Fenimore Cooper and Washington Irving set their
works in the United States and were responsible for creating and
crystallizing ideas about American culture and landscape that remain
common in American literature and imagination to this day. If you have
heard the legend of Rip Van Winkle or seen a western movie or television
show, you have seen evidence of the influence of these authors.**

**3.2 Seeking a Literary Identity: Poetry** <span id="3.2"></span> 
**The first group of American poets to gain wide popularity in both the
United States and England later came to be referred to as the Fireside
Poets; they include Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, William Cullen Bryant,
James Russell Lowell, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and John Greenleaf
Whittier. Like James Fenimore Cooper and Washington Irving, they often
wrote about themes of nature, and like the earlier colonial writers,
they were interested in ideas of the human soul, death, and potential
salvation. They generally wrote in traditional poetic forms. In previous
generations, a common homework assignment was to memorize and recite
poetry from one of these poets, such as “Paul Revere’s Ride” or “The
Song of Hiawatha.” In this unit, you will read some examples of poems
from these writers as well as learn about some of the elements of
poetry.**

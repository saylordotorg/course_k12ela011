**Unit 6: Expanding Freedom: Literature from the Civil War and Women’s
Suffrage** <span id="6"></span> 
**In our study of American literature thus far, we have explored the
literature of those individuals with the freedom to express themselves
openly* *-mostly white men. Up until this period in American history,
not all citizens had this freedom; however, this was about to change.
The Civil War and Women’s Suffrage Movement would finally open our
country’s ears to the voices of those who had been marginalized for so
long. In this unit, we will listen to those powerful voices from the
past and honor their impressive contributions to the freedoms we all
enjoy today.**

**6.5 The Red Badge of Courage** <span id="6.5"></span> 
**Stephen Crane’s novel The Red Badge of Courage has been called the
most vivid portrayal of battle during the Civil War period. Told from
the perspective of a young soldier, the book depicts vivid battle scenes
as well as the emotions that war inevitably evokes. Though fiction, the
novel reads as a firsthand account of battle and is a model of a new
style of literature born from this era: realism. **

**6.6 Women’s Suffrage Movement in America** <span id="6.6"></span> 
**After the Civil War was over, the women’s suffrage movement was
reinvigorated. Many civil rights activists were pushing for the 15th
Amendment, which would give black men the right to vote. This reminded
women that they too deserved a voice. As most any social movement does,
women’s suffrage inspired artists, including authors, to speak out on
the issue, either in matters of public policy or simply as a method of
self-expression. **

     Instructions: In 1848, suffragist Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote the
    Declaration of Sentiments and Resolutions, cleverly basing it on
    Thomas Jefferson’s iconic Declaration of Independence. Read the
    declaration. Then, refer back to the Declaration of Independence in
    subunit 2.2.3.2 and note how the declarations are similar in both
    structure and word choice.  

    -   What is the impact of these similarities?
    -   Does it make Stanton’s declaration more impactful?
    -   Show the two documents to a friend or family member and debate
        whether the similarities heighten or undermine Stanton’s
        argument.

    Reading these declarations and completing this activity should take
    approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: Mrs. Mallard says little of nothing in the “The Story
    of an Hour,” but she does a lot of thinking. Our thoughts can say a
    lot about us. Carefully read all of the text on each of the seven
    slides in the slideshow on characterization through thoughts.  
        
     Then, write a paragraph about how Chopin reveals Mrs. Mallard’s
    character through her thoughts. List three of Mrs. Mallard’s traits
    and indicate how each of them is revealed through her “private”
    thoughts. Do Mrs. Mallard’s thoughts contradict her actions?

    Link: SOPHIA: LaShanda Lawrence’s [“Situational
    Irony”](http://www.sophia.org/situational-irony/situational-irony-tutorial)  
      
     Instructions: In Kate Chopin’s “The Story of an Hour,” the end of
    the story is something quite different than what the reader expects.
    This is referred to as situational irony. Read the text on each of
    the seven slides and then, go back to slide three.  

    -   Do you think that the situational irony in this story
        accomplishes all four of these purposes?
    -   Why or why not?

    Now, go to the final slide. Write a brief description of the
    situational irony in “The Story of an Hour” as if you were adding a
    bullet point to the slideshow. Finally, write a letter Chopin
    commenting on how she decided to end the story.  
    -   Do you think it was a realistic ending?
    -   Should Mrs. Mallard have reacted differently to her husband’s
        homecoming?
    -   Why do you think she reacts the way she does? Address your
        opinions on these questions in your letter.

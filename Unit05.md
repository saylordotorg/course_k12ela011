**Unit 5: Contemplating Mortality: The Dark Romantics** <span
id="5"></span> 
*As you learned in the last unit, the transcendentalists believed that
we are all part of the divine soul and as such, are inherently good. Not
everyone agreed, however. In fact, the dark romantics were keenly aware
of the evil in the world and in themselves and sought to make sense of
it through their literature. Though undeniably pessimistic, this
subgenre in American literature brought about some of the most
suspenseful and entertaining works the world had yet to see.*

**5.1 Dark Romanticism** <span id="5.1"></span> 
**In this unit, you will explore the dark and melancholy worlds of Emily
Dickinson and Edgar Allen Poe. Their works chilled readers and
successfully defined a literary subgenre, called both dark romanticism
and Gothicism. While delving into Dickinson’s poems and Poe’s short
stories, you will examine the literary devices, tools, and techniques
used to create such haunting and suspenseful reads.**

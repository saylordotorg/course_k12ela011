### Course Information

Welcome to American Literature. Below, please find general information
on this course and its requirements.  
    
 **Course Designer:** [Mrs. Melissa
Maypole](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-h-n/#MrsMelissaMaypole)  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following:  

-   *Outline of American Literature*(a US State Department Publication)
    by Kathryn VanSpanckeren
-   *The Scarlet Letter* by Nathaniel Hawthorne
-   *The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin*
-   The Constitution of the United States

-   *This Side of Paradise* by F. Scott Fitzgerald

**Requirements for Completion: **In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
The course builds upon itself from one unit to the next, so it is
important to work thoroughly through each section to understand those
that follow.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** Completing this course should take about
**205 hours and 30 minutes**. Each unit includes a time advisory that
lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.
These should help you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to
take a look at these time advisories and determine how much time you
have over the next few weeks to complete each unit and then set goals
for yourself.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** There will be many occasions where you will need
to take notes, and you will also frequently be writing responses to
literature. Some of the readings will be challenging; if needed, you can
complete them in multiple sittings.  
    
 *How to take notes in a digital text:*  
  
 [**Scrible**](http://www.scrible.com/#news)  
 If you are using a computer, you can use Scrible, which is a toolbar
that you save as a link. It allows you to edit any webpage by
highlighting sections, leaving notes, changing the color of text, and so
forth. As you work your way through Saylor’s courses, Scrible allows you
to leave the pen and notepad at home and take notes directly on the
screen you’re learning from. Save a tree and Scrible away!   
  
 **Adobe Reader
App **[**(Android)**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.reader&hl=en)** or **[**(iOS)**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adobe-reader/id469337564?mt=8)  
 If you are using an iPad, iPhone, or any android type device, you can
use the Adobe Reader app. Similar to Scrible, the Adobe Reader app will
allow you to highlight, draw on, and add text to PDFs (one form of media
Scrible does not work on). For example, say you’re taking [K12ELA11:
American Literature](http://www.saylor.org/courses/k12ela11/), which
relies heavily on Scott McLean's *Writing for Success* text, one of
Saylor.org’s many complete texts available on
our [bookshelf](http://www.saylor.org/books/). If you had this app
downloaded to your mobile device, you could import that PDF text
and voilà!  
 It’s easy to mark up the text for later review.  
    
 [**VideoNot.es**](http://www.videonot.es/)  
 This has the same idea as Scrible and the Adobe Reader App, but this
tool lets you take notes on videos. With this tool, you can say goodbye
to constantly pausing the video lecture you’re watching to take notes.
It features side-by-side note taking, and it’s all saved in the cloud!  
    

[**GoodNotes**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodnotes-free-take-notes/id483679173?mt=8)  
 If you have an iPad, you may want to use GoodNotes, which is an app
that allows you to write notes, highlight text, and export your files to
Dropbox for continued use on other devices. GoodNotes also allows you to
import files from iTunes, which means you can access all Saylor files
currently uploaded to iTunes U.  
    
 [**Evernote**](https://evernote.com/)  
 Evernote is an app available for Windows, Macintosh, Android, and iOS
devices. The app allows you to import documents that you can then
annotate, highlight, and save for later reference. Evernote also updates
documents across all of your devices, so if you are working on your iPad
and decide to switch to your computer, you can start right where you
left off.  
    
 [**NOOK**](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/u/Compare-NOOKs/379003181)  
 If you have a NOOK tablet, you can create notes and highlight text
right in the device. Just right click inside a text and begin writing
notes. If you want to highlight, you can drag your finger across the
text, and right click to highlight.

**1.1 Early Colonial Life and Values** <span id="1.1"></span> 
**What was it like to live in the colonial times? If you have even a
vague idea of the kinds of lives early Americans lived, it’s only
because of the writers of the day. In order to understand the literature
that they produced, you must first have an understanding of their world,
which was very different from our modern-day society. **

     Instructions: Scroll down and listen to the entire audio lecture
    entitled “Part 2, Preface & Chapter 1 -The Colonial Period, 1607 -
    1765.” As you listen, take notes on the connections the speaker
    makes between the history of the colonial period and the literature
    produced during this period.  

    -   What does she say about the literary significance of this early
        literature?
    -   How does she explain the lack of noteworthy literature during
        this period?
    -   What adjectives does she use to describe the literature that
        does exist? 

    In addition, take notes on how the speaker characterizes the life
    and values of the early settlers. What kinds of people were the
    Puritans, according to the speaker? Make a list of traits. Keep
    these notes handy as you proceed through the rest of this unit.  
        
     Listening to this audio book and completing this exercise should
    take approximately 1 hour.

**1.2 Early Colonial Literature** <span id="1.2"></span> 
**Although they may not have thought of themselves as “authors,” per se,
early colonial writers made important contributions to the foundation of
American literature by documenting historical information. Without these
early writings, we would not have a clear picture of what life was like
for colonial Americans. In this subunit, we will be looking at the works
of some of the most notable writers of the day. **

     Then, find similar examples of inversion in Anne Bradstreet’s

    as you can find.  
        
     Next, go back to the poem and substitute the inverted sentences
    into normal word order. Then read the full poem without the
    inversion and compare the two versions.  

    -   Which is better?
    -   Why do you think Bradstreet decided to use inversion in her
        poem?

**1.2.3.1 Who Was Nathaniel Hawthorne?** <span id="1.2.3.1"></span> 
*Nathaniel Hawthorne is one of America’s best-known writers. One of his
ancestors was an infamous judge in the Salem witch trials, a dark stain
on the fabric of American history. Perhaps because of his lineage,
Hawthorne became quite interested in the evils of humanity, and though
he was born much later, he set much of his work during the Puritan time
period. *

        to life for a contemporary audience?

-   **Reading: *The Crucible* by Arthur Miller**
    *The Crucible*is a famous play based on the Salem witch trials that
    occurred in Massachusetts from 1692 - 1693. Though it is historical
    fiction, it accurately portrays many of the events that occurred
    during the trials and is a reflection of America’s strict,
    Puritanical roots.

**Unit 2: Reason and Enlightenment in America** <span id="2"></span> 
**In the previous unit, you explored the thoughts and concerns of some
of the earliest Americans. In addition to their basic survival, these
Puritans were very focused on their religion, perhaps because the line
between life and the afterlife seemed to be such a thin one. In history
courses, you learn about how citizens began to have new ideas about
liberty, equality, and freedom as the colonies grew and became well
established. Americans read and internalized the literature of the
enlightenment, which emphasized reason, experimentation, and logic
instead of tradition, superstition, and fate. In this unit, you will not
only be exposed to these new ideals of reason and enlightenment, but you
will also examine the very texts that were written with the spirit of
these ideas in mind: the US foundational documents. Through these
readings, you can trace how enlightenment thinking came to form the
central character and culture of the United States.*  
    
 *In US political discussions you often hear questions about what the
Founding Fathers intended and the principles upon which the country was
founded. In this unit, you will examine and analyze these texts for
yourself and formulate arguments in response to those questions. You
will also be invited to adopt the writing style of some of the US
Founding Fathers as you draft both an autobiography and a persuasive
essay.**

**2.1 The Age of Reason and Enlightenment: Breaking Free** <span
id="2.1"></span> 
**As you learned from studying Nathaniel Hawthorne’s novel, The Scarlet
Letter, and Arthur Miller’s play, The Crucible, the Puritans lived under
very strict religious guidelines. As Americans learned more about
science, however, they began to question their long-held religious
beliefs. During this period, called the Age of Reason and Enlightenment,
many writers and scholars began to entertain the idea that God played
less of a direct role in the everyday lives of humans, though few of
them declared themselves atheists.**

lived.**

     Instructions: As intelligent and logical thinkers, the writers of
    the Age of Reason and Enlightenment were very good at making
    persuasive arguments. Now that you’ve analyzed some of their
    rhetorical devices, it is time to try your hand at drafting a
    persuasive essay of your own.  
        
     The first step is to choose a topic.  Browse this list of
    persuasive essay topics. You may choose one of these topics or come
    up with a similar one. As you brainstorm for ideas, keep in mind
    that the more passionate you are about the subject, the more
    persuasively you will be able to argue it. Take a few minutes to
    think of something you feel strongly about, jot down some ideas, and
    choose a topic for your persuasive essay before moving on to the
    next activity.  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 30 minutes.
